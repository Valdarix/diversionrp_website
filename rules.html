                        <p>Staff members may hold multiple roles within our server, but they must consistently meet the expectations associated with each position. Staff and department/group leaders are required to keep all sensitive server informationâ€”such as documents, player data, designs, and plansâ€”strictly confidential and solely for use within our server. Any documents or assets created, obtained, or related to our server (e.g., departmental, administrative, or server business materials) are owned by the server owner and must remain intact and unaltered upon a staff memberâ€™s departure.</p>

                <p>Our city encourages players to share their experiences freely. You are welcome to stream, post TikToks, create YouTube videos, or share other content on social media without needing to go through tedious applications or possess a streaming background. We believe that anyone who wishes to stream should have the freedom to do so. Additionally, there is no requirement for our staff members to be moderators in your streams.</p>
                <p class="mt-4">It is your responsibility to adhere to the guidelines and community standards of your chosen streaming platform. However, we have a few guidelines that we believe will benefit both Just RP and the streamer:</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Not a Streamer-Focused City</h3>
                <p>Our city is not built around streamers, nor is it owned by streamers. The success and stability of our city do not rely on the viewership or income of any individual streamer.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Follow All Server Rules</h3>
                <p>Streamers are required to follow ALL server rules without exception. No special accommodations will be made to enhance your stream. Streamers are subject to the same moderation guidelines as non-streamers.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Do Not Show Secret Locations</h3>
                <p>Locations considered secretâ€”such as labs, material gathering spots, money laundering areas, black markets, etc.â€”should not be intentionally shown on your stream. Keeping these aspects of the city hidden enhances the overall role play experience for everyone.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">City Branding</h3>
                <p>While we hope Just RP becomes your primary city, we do not restrict you from streaming other cities as well. However, when you do stream Just RP, we ask that you include the cityâ€™s name in your stream title.

                <p>Role play is the foundation of our city. While we provide opportunities for crimes, drugs, fast cars, guns, and more, these elements are intended to enrich your role play stories, not dominate them. We do not support a "100k or Die" mentality or aim to be an enhanced version of GTA Onlineâ€”there are plenty of other servers for that. If thatâ€™s the experience youâ€™re seeking, we encourage you to explore those options.</p>
                <p class="mt-4">The following rules are established to help you stay within the boundaries of meaningful role play:</p>

                        Failure to Role-play/Unrealistic RP (FailRP)
                    </h3>
                    <div id="subsection13" class="collapsible-content hidden p-3 bg-gray-600 border-2 border-gray-500 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
                        <p>Failing to role-play (FailRP) is strictly prohibited and taken very seriously. Just RP is a realistic role-play server, and you are expected to stay in character and actively participate in role-play at all times. If rules are broken, your priority should be to continue role-playing through the situation and report the issue afterward.</p>
                        <p class="mt-2">FailRP includes, but is not limited to, the following behaviors:</p>
                        <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                            <li>Ignoring Role-play Scenarios: Refusing to engage in or acknowledge role-play situations that involve your character.</li>
                            <li>Breaking Character (OOC): Going out of character without a valid reason, particularly during active role-play scenes. OOC should never be used to end or alter the direction of a scene.</li>
                            <li>Unrealistic Actions: Engaging in actions that would be impossible or highly unrealistic in real life, such as repeatedly jumping off buildings without injury, pulling large weapons out of nowhere, taking on a group when outnumbered, or failing to fear for your life. Driving cars in unrealistic ways, or at unrealistic speeds.</li>
                            <li>Using OOC to Influence RP: Using OOC chat to influence or control the direction of the role-play instead of letting the scene develop naturally.</li>
                            <li>Failing to Use Scripted Features: Not utilizing available in-game scripts and features designed to enhance realism, such as ignoring injury systems, vehicle damage, or other mechanics.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="mt-2">Players are expected to use the provided scripted features to create a realistic and immersive role-play environment. Continuously typing in OOC chat while another player is trying to engage in role-play is also considered FailRP and will not be tolerated. Disrupting the immersive experience through FailRP will result in disciplinary action.</p>

                        <p>Killing another player with little or no engaged role-play is strictly forbidden. Random Death match (RDM) and Vehicle Death match (VDM) are not tolerated.</p>
                        <p class="mt-2"><strong>Random Death match (RDM):</strong></p>
                        <p>RDM refers to killing or attempting to kill another player without proper intent or role-play. Killing on sight without proper escalation is not allowed and is considered a form of RDM. Proper escalation involves ongoing interactions that naturally lead to violence, making deadly actions justifiable.</p>
                        <p class="mt-2"><strong>Vehicle Death match (VDM):</strong></p>
                        <p>VDM involves using a vehicle to kill or attempt to kill another player without intent or role-play. Similar to RDM, this behavior is unacceptable unless it is part of a properly escalated role-play scenario.</p>
                        <p class="mt-2"><strong>Deadly Actions Must Have RP Behind Them:</strong></p>
                        <p>Any use of deadly force should be supported by role-play. If an incident escalates to the point where deadly actions are taken, it must be the result of an ongoing role-play scene.</p>

                        <p>Power gaming is the act of using in-game mechanics, external information, or role-play concepts to unfairly or unrealistically benefit your character, disrupting the balance of the role-play experience.</p>
                        <p class="mt-2">Examples of power gaming include, but are not limited to:</p>

                            <li>Unrealistic Hostage Situations: Kidnapping a cop to get your friend out of jail is considered power gaming because it forces law enforcement to value the hostageâ€™s life and negotiate, leaving them with limited options.

                            <li><strong>Third-Party VOIP Applications:</strong> While being in Discord calls, TeamSpeak, or other external chat systems is acceptable, all in-city decisions, plans, and character-related conversations should take place within the city using in-game voice chat, radios, and phones. Using external communication tools to coordinate or influence in-game actions in a way that bypasses in-game interactions is considered meta gaming.</li>
                            <li><strong>Abusing Staff Powers:</strong> Using powers granted by your staff position to unfairly influence or manipulate in-game situations. Staff members must separate their staff duties from their role-play actions and should not use their authority to gain an in-game advantage.</li>

                        Safe Zones

                    <div id="subsection18" class="collapsible-content hidden p-3 bg-gray-600 border-2 border-gray-500 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
                        <p>Safe Zones are designated areas where crime is strictly prohibited. It is considered FailRP to escape from a crime by entering a safe zone. However, if a role-play (RP) scenario begins outside a safe zone and naturally continues into one, the criminal RP may proceed, but it must be handled realistically. Be aware that loitering in a safe zone removes your federal protection.</p>
                        <p class="mt-2">The following are considered safe zones:</p>
                        <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                            <li><strong>Inside Hospitals:</strong> No retaliatory crimes are allowed within hospital premises.</li>
                            <li><strong>Spawn Locations:</strong> Spawn locations are designated SAFE ZONES. This includes any spot on the spawn selection map and any teleport or entrance into an apartment or building in the city. Players must be allowed to move freely from these locations. However, if players loiter in these areas, the protected status is forfeited.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="mt-2"><strong>Note on Police Departments and Other Non-Protected Areas:</strong> While Police Departments and similar locations are not protected as safe zones, any role-play involving sieges, attacks, or similar actions must be conducted realistically. This means ensuring enough players are involved to make the scenario believable and that the role-play intent is strong and well-developed. These actions should not be used simply as a means to constantly rescue a friend from arrest.</p>

                        <p>Fear RP requires you to respond to in-game situations as you would in real life if faced with a dangerous scenario. This is an RP server, and you must act as though you genuinely fear for your life.</p>
                        <p class="mt-2"><strong>For example:</strong></p>

                            <li><strong>Armed Robbery:</strong> If a masked individual enters your workplace and demands money at gunpoint, comply with their demands. Attempting to fight back or trigger a silent alarm without carefully considering the risks would break Fear RP.</li>
                            <li><strong>Kidnapping:</strong> If you're surrounded by armed individuals who force you into a vehicle, comply rather than attempting to overpower them. Escaping without a realistic chance of survival is not in line with Fear RP.</li>
                            <li><strong>Gang Confrontation:</strong> If outnumbered by a rival gang in a secluded area, comply with their demands. Retaliating or trying to escape when outgunned is unrealistic and breaks Fear RP.</li>
                            <li><strong>Traffic Stop Gone Wrong:</strong> As a police officer pulling over known gang members, if additional gang members arrive and surround you, recognize the danger. De-escalate, call for backup discreetly or comply with demands if your life is threatened. Drawing your weapon or making arrests without a backup would be unrealistic.</li>

Engaging in serial killer RP without these elements is not allowed and will be treated as FailRP.</p>

                        <p class="mt-2">A maximum of 2 hostages is allowed, with a reasonable number of robbers to manage them. Hostages cannot be taken from the scene after the crime is committed. Law enforcement will intervene to prevent this.</p>
                        <p class="mt-2">If a ransom is requested, the hostage must be exchanged for the money. The total ransom allowed is $50,000 per hostage, payable in cash only, with police required to negotiate.</p>

                        <p class="mt-2">Motorcycles/ATVs should not be used in robberies (this rule may be revised). The robbery must be fully planned before it starts; no additional people or hostages can be added after the robbery begins.</p>
                        <p class="mt-2">Robbers must carry a backpack or bag during the robbery to represent where stolen items are stored, including AR-type rifles.</p>

                                <li>Police Backup: Cops should evaluate situations during stops or encounters. If the person involved is a high-profile criminal or the situation could escalate, calling for backup is justified.</li>

                                <li>Unrelated Interference: Do not interfere in scenes where you have no legitimate reason to be involved. For example, donâ€™t step in to help someone you donâ€™t know who is dealing with a cop.</li>
                                <li>Looting Unrelated Scenes: Running up to a scene you werenâ€™t part of just to rob downed players or steal from cars is prohibited.</li>

                                <li>Neutral Observers: If you witness a crime or police action but have no direct involvement, donâ€™t intervene unless it aligns with your characterâ€™s role or storyline.</li>

                            <li><strong>Identity and Symbols:</strong> Members share a common identity, typically linked to a name, and often use other symbols. This identity is recognized both by the members themselves and by others. This can include a common name, slogan, sign, symbol, tattoo, style or color of clothing, hairstyle, hand sign, or graffiti.</li>
                            <li><strong>Permanence and Organization:</strong> Gangs have a degree of organization and some level of permanence, distinguishing them from temporary groups. The organization can range from loose associations to highly structured hierarchies.</li>
                            <li><strong>Criminal Activity:</strong> A key characteristic of gangs is their involvement in an elevated level of criminal activity. Members engage in these activities with the intent to enhance or preserve the gangâ€™s power, reputation, or economic resources.</li>
                            <li><strong>Group Size:</strong> A gang typically consists of 6 to 10 members. These members collectively adopt a group identity that they use to create an atmosphere of fear or intimidation, often through violence or criminal activities.</li>
                            <li><strong>Purpose and Objectives:</strong> The primary purpose of a gang, at least in part, is to engage in criminal activity. They frequently use violence or intimidation to achieve their criminal objectives, and their actions are often aimed at enhancing the gangâ€™s influence, reputation, or financial standing.</li>
                            <li><strong>Whitelisted:</strong> Gangs are special entities in our city. You must be an approved gang to act as a gang. Civilians are not allowed to represent themselves in any way that could give off the appearance they are a gang.</li>

                        <p><strong>New Gangs:</strong> New gangs must be approved by staff and are selected from the list of available gangs within the city. To begin the process, players interested in forming a new gang must submit an application detailing their gangâ€™s concept, objectives, and planned activities. The application will be reviewed by the staff team to ensure it aligns with the city's role-play standards and guidelines.</p>
                        <p class="mt-2">Once approved, all new gangs will enter a 21-day probationary period during which no rule breaks can occur without risking disbandment. During this probation period, new gangs are permitted to engage in all gang-related activities, but they must operate with heightened caution to ensure compliance with server rules. This probationary period allows the staff to assess the gang's behavior and integration into the city's role-play environment.</p>
                        <p class="mt-2">Failure to adhere to server rules during this probationary period may result in immediate disbandment of the gang.</p>

                        <p>Gangs are expected to behave as gangs, not as social clubs, book clubs, or community groups. It is crucial that gangs actively participate in activities that reinforce their role in the city's criminal underworld. This includes:</p>
                        <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                            <li><strong>Forming Long-Term Rivalries:</strong> Gangs should develop and maintain rivalries with other gangs, leading to ongoing conflicts and power struggles.</li>
                            <li><strong>Turf Disputes:</strong> Engaging in disputes over territory is a key aspect of gang life. Gangs are expected to fight for control of areas that are important to their operations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Petty Crime and Criminal Enterprises:</strong> Gangs should regularly engage in petty crimes, as well as organize long-term criminal enterprises aimed at increasing the gangâ€™s status and influence within the city.</li>

                        <p class="mt-2">Failure to meet these expectations can result in the loss of your gangâ€™s status and disbandment.</p>
                        <p class="mt-2"><strong>Compliance with Server Rules:</strong> Gangs are expected to follow all server rules, including during interactions with law enforcement officers (LEOs). Any criminal actions, whether inside or outside gang territory, must adhere to the serverâ€™s General Rules.</p>
                        <p class="mt-2"><strong>Criminal Activity in Turf:</strong> Gang members must not commit petty crimes (store robberies, house robberies, etc.) within their own turf. Engaging in criminal activities should be focused on rival territories or neutral areas.</p>
                        <p class="mt-2"><strong>Leadership Responsibility:</strong> Gang leaders are responsible for ensuring that their members comply with all server rules.</p>

                            <li><strong>Territory Control:</strong> Gangs that control a territory have the right to chase out any unwanted persons who pose a threat. This includes protecting the territory from rival gangs and enforcing dominance within the area.</li>
                            <li><strong>Civilian Criminal Activity:</strong> If civilians are caught selling drugs or robbing stores within gang-controlled territory, the controlling gang can impose taxes, issue threats, or enforce other penalties, except when safe passage must be allowed. However, gangs must not interfere with police conducting routine business, such as traffic stops, unless it directly involves the gang.</li>
                            <li><strong>Gang Colors and Escalation:</strong> Gangs can escalate to violence if a civilian is seen wearing their custom EUP or gang mask, as this could be considered false flagging and may result in perma-death. However, if a civilian is simply role-playing in the territory without criminal intent, gangs should not escalate to shooting. A knockout or stabbing is sufficient.</li>
                            <li><strong>Unlimited Gang Protection:</strong> When civilians cause trouble in gang territory, there is no limit to the number of gang members who can protect their turf. This can include imposing taxes, issuing threats, or resorting to violence as necessary.</li>

                        <p><strong>Rivalries:</strong> Gang rivalries should naturally escalate from disrespect, turf disputes, or fistfights, but all-out combat should be rare and well-justified. These should be long-term and impactful. You should not be hanging out with members of other gangs.</p>
                        <p class="mt-2"><strong>Escalation to Combat:</strong> Full-scale combat is permitted if a rivalry becomes too heated. In such cases, all members from both sides may participate in open fire without player limits. However, randomly initiating shootouts with other gangs is not acceptable, and frequent gang shootouts indicate poor role-play that needs correction.</p>

                        <p class="mt-2"><strong>Police Risk:</strong> Law enforcement officers enter active gang interactions at their own risk.

                        <p class="mt-2"><strong>Car Colors:</strong> Gangs cannot dictate the color of other playersâ€™ cars. However, knowingly painting your car the color used by a gang could cause you to be mistaken for that gang and put you in some tricky role-play scenarios.</p>
                        <p class="mt-2"><strong>Color and Territory:</strong> Gang colors and territories are predetermined by the gang selected in the city.

A player who often hops between gangs, seeks membership in other gangs, or creates a bad track record could result in role-play consequences for both the player hopping around and his future gangs. It could lead to rivalries where none existed before. Demands from the player's old gang, and damage to the reputation of the player who is hopping from gang to gang. Leaders should take their roster slots seriously and players should vet the gangs they want to join thoroughly before joining.</p>

                        <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                            <li><strong>Submit Evidence:</strong> All reports must include evidence in the form of screenshots or unedited clips with sound. If you have multiple clips, thatâ€™s perfectly fineâ€”submit them all. Reports without evidence will be dismissed and should be resolved through role-play in the city.</li>
                            <li><strong>Prepare Your Ticket:</strong> Before submitting a ticket, make sure you have all your evidence ready. Your ticket should include all necessary details about the situation when you open the ticket. Moderation and staff should not need to request additional information or have to wait for your evidence. Donâ€™t just open the ticket as a placeholder until you get around to it.</li>
                            <li><strong>Review Your Evidence:</strong> Review all of your evidence before submitting, make sure your clips are working, have sound, that your screenshots show what you think they do, etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cite the Rule:</strong> When submitting a report, identify the specific rule from this rulebook that you believe was broken. Include this rule with your evidence. For example, saying â€˜Gang Rules: Rule 2 Gang Membership and Minimumsâ€™ would be perfect and speed up your incident handling.</li>
                            <li><strong>Response Time:</strong> Tickets will generally be handled within a 48-hour window. Failure to respond to staff inquiries in a timely manner could result in your ticket being closed due to lack of response.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="mt-2">Following these steps will help ensure that your report is handled efficiently and fairly.</p>

Instead, use the proper channels within Discordâ€”follow the appropriate chain of command or open a support ticket. Staff should never handle city-related incidents through DMs. The only acceptable response from staff to a DM about an issue should be: "Please open a ticket so we can review."

                        <p>The first level of disciplinary action in our city is a warning. If you are caught breaking any of the official Rules & Regulations, a member of our staff team will issue a warning.</p>
                        <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                            <li><strong>Active Warnings:</strong> You can receive up to three (3) active warnings for minor infractions before a strike is issued. Warnings remain active for 30 days. If you accumulate three active warnings and commit another infraction, you will receive a strike.</li>
                            <li><strong>Warning Expiry:</strong> Once a warning falls off after 30 days, it no longer counts towards your active warnings, but it will still be recorded in your overall tracker. This means that even after a warning expires, it remains part of your disciplinary history.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="mt-2">This system is designed to encourage rule compliance and provide a fair process for addressing minor rule violations.</p>

                        <p>A strike represents a more serious offense and does not expire. Certain serious offenses will result in an automatic strike, even if you have no prior warnings.</p>
                        <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                            <li><strong>Automatic Strike:</strong> For more severe rule violations, a strike may be issued immediately, bypassing the warning stage altogether.</li>
                            <li><strong>Warnings Leading to a Strike:</strong> If you have three (3) active warnings, the moderation team is required to issue a strike for any additional infractions, regardless of their severity.</li>
                            <li><strong>Consequences:</strong> A strike may be accompanied by a temporary suspension from the city. The duration and specifics of the suspension are determined by the moderation team based on the nature of the offense.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="mt-2">Moderation may also issue restrictions in some instances where they feel a temporary vacation is not warranted. For example, if you get in trouble on your criminal character, but you have a cop. Moderation may decide to issue you a restriction that only allows you to play your cop for a period of time. Breaking the restriction as outlined by moderation will result in an immediate 7-day suspension.</p>
                        <p class="mt-2">Strikes serve as a strong deterrent against repeat and serious rule violations, ensuring that the city remains a fair and respectful environment for all players.</p>
