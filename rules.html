                <p>
                    We expect all community members to roleplay to the highest possible standard and remain in character while in-game. A person must act in the confines of the character they have created and are currently playing as, if you wish to switch characters you must log out of the server and log back in as your new character.

                <p>
                   All community members must be respectful at all times while in-city or on our community platforms. This means that users must never be involved with or publish any content that is deemed racist, homophobic, sexist, prejudiced, or disrespectful. We also forbid the sharing or publishing of any sexually explicit content on any of our community platforms.

                    DRP strives to create a city where everyone can enjoy their time. This city and community are meant to be places that everyone can enjoy their off time. At the end of the day, this is a game and we want people to enjoy their time playing it.

                    </h3>
                    <div id="subsection2" class="collapsible-content hidden p-3 bg-gray-600 border-2 border-gray-500 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
                        <p>Please carefully observe the following guidelines to ensure a respectful and harmonious environment:</p>
                        <br>
                        <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                            <li>Respectful Communication on Official Platforms: Communications related to DRP, whether in-game or on official DRP platforms, including streamer channels, must always be respectful. Refrain from sending angry or offensive messages resulting from in-game events.</li>
                            <li>In-Character Interaction: We understand that in-character (IC) interaction can include trash talk and abrasive behavior as part of the role-playing experience. This is acceptable as long as it remains in character and does not breach the boundaries of respect or target players out of character (OOC).</li>
                            <li>Boundary Between IC and OOC: Any behavior that crosses from in-character to out-of-character, especially if it becomes disrespectful or offensive, is not permissible. Maintaining this distinction is crucial to ensure that in-game dynamics do not lead to personal conflicts or breaches of our community standards.</li>
                            <li>Private Interactions: Direct messages (DMs) between individuals, if not involving official DRP platforms, are generally beyond our scope, respecting your privacy in personal matters. However, extreme cases such as stalking or sexually explicit content, if reported and impacting in-city dynamics, will be addressed firmly.</li>
                            <li>Disputes with Staff: If you disagree with a staff ruling, please address it constructively. Instead of direct confrontation, submit a ticket for a formal review of the issue. This approach promotes a more effective resolution process.</li>
                            <li>No Trolling: Engaging in behavior intended to provoke or disturb players, members, police, staff, etc., under any circumstances, is strictly prohibited.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <p>Your commitment to these guidelines is essential. They are designed not only to maintain order but to enhance everyone's gaming experience.</p>

                        <p>Power-gaming is the act of using an in-game mechanic, any external information, or a roleplay concept to favor your own character or story, and give yourself an unfair or unrealistic advantage. (No running to teleportation markers to escape, such as running into your apartment or anywhere that is not accessible by others.</p> <br> <p>This includes an example of doing a robbery, getting in a chase and running to a garage, and putting your vehicle away.</p> <br><p>If you are still in your original vehicle then there must be a 10-minute wait period to store that vehicle, repair, modify or pull another vehicle after a pursuit.) Another example of powergaming would be kidnapping a cop to get your friend out of jail. </p><br> <p>The reason it is seen as powergaming is because LEO’s have to value the hostages life and negotiate. </p><br> <p>There are ways to break your friends out of jail other than kidnapping a cop. <br> <p>Also, If you are asked for your federal ID in-game, you are required to give it for reporting purposes or face disciplinary actions!</p>

                            <li>Driving in the city limits constantly at 100mph+ is also unrealistic.</li>

                        <p>Gang Wars must follow a natural evolution of roleplay. Something crucial within RP must happen between the two parties in order for a war to happen. In most cases the request for peace must be accepted unless there is a very good reason to push for more war; however, peace can come at a cost.</p>

                            <li>A gang support ticket must be opened for the initiating gang to get war approval.</li>
                            <li>To start a gang war an in-city parley must happen with The Elite Order present to discuss the terms of the war. At this time violence must not occur.</li>
                            <li>The Elite order will issue flags to both gangs, whichever gang collects the majority of the opposing gangs’ flags, wins.</li>
                            <li>After someone is downed for any reason you must sit out the rest of that round.</li>
                            <li>Gang wars become on sight with minimal interaction.</li>
                            <li> If rules are broken, the war gets excessively toxic or goes federal, the war will be stopped and the gang with the most flags wins.</li>
                            <li>Gangs can only be in one war at a time. A two-week waiting period must be waited before the initiating can declare war on the same gang again. There is no cooldown for initiating war with another gang, but must have a valid reason with supporting RP to warrant a war.</li>
                            <li>Gangs must conduct gang wars in their respective colors. Anyone not in Gang colors must either leave and not come back during the scene, or surrender.  If vehicles bearing the color of an attacking/retaliating gang enter a gang turf, they are subject to being fired upon.</li>
                            <li> Only members on your roster can be involved in the war, this does not include hang-arounds.</li>
